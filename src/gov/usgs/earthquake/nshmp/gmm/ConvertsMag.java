/**
 * Implemented by ground motion models (GMMs) that perform a magnitude

 *
 * <p>At present such conversions are restricted to the 7 ground motion models
 * (GMMs) used for 2008 CEUS gridded seismicity sources. All are designed to
 * work with M<sub>w</sub> but the grid source magnitudes are presented as
 * m<sub>b</sub>. Note that {@link ToroEtAl_1997} provides m<sub>b</sub>
 * specific coefficients and does not need to implement to this interface.
