 * {@code enum} identifier and its {@link Gmm#instance(Imt)} method. Concrete
 * implementations are public solely for the purpose of documentation.
 *
 * <p>Models generally have a single concrete implementation. However, for those
 * supplying region- or source-specific variants, there will typically be an
 * abstract base-model implementation and subclasses to handle each flavor (e.g.
 * {@link ZhaoEtAl_2006}. Each flavor has a unique {@link Gmm} identifier.
